Setup cross cluster replication for Aiven for OpenSearchÂ® |beta|
================================================================

.. note:: 
    - Cross cluster replication feature for Aiven for OpenSearch is a beta release. 
    - Cross cluster replication is not available for Hobbyist and Startup plans.

Follow these steps to set up :doc:`cross cluster replication <../concepts/cross-cluster-replication-opensearch>` for your Aiven for OpenSearch service: 

1. From the **Services** page in the `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_, select the Aiven for OpenSearch service for which you want to set up cross cluster replication. 
2. In the service's **Overview** tab, scroll down to the **Cross cluster replications** section and click **Create follower**.
3. In the **Create OpenSearch follow cluster** page, 

   * Enter a name for the follower cluster 
   * Select the desired cloud provider
   * Select the desired cloud region
   * Select the service plan
  
   .. note:: 
      During creation, the follower cluster service must have the same service plan as the leader cluster service. This ensures the follower cluster service has as much memory as the leader cluster. You can change the service plan as required later. 
   
   * Add additional disk storage based on your business requirements
4. Click **Create**.

The follower cluster service will be in a `Rebuilding` state, and, once complete, the follower cluster will be ready to pull all data and indexes from the leader service. 

.. note:: 
   To learn about the current limitations with cross cluster replications for Aiven for OpenSearch, see the :ref:`Limitations <ccr-limitatons>` section. 

View follower cluster services
-------------------------------

You can view all the follower cluster services configured for your OpenSearch service either from the **Service integration** section on the service **Overview** page or in the **Integrations** tab. 
Additionally, the OpenSearch services display **Leader** and **Follower** tags below the service name to help identify leader cluster and follower cluster services. 

Setup cross-cluster replication via API 
---------------------------------------

You can set up the cross cluster replication for Aiven for OpenSearch service using the service integration endpoint and setting the ``integration-type`` to ``opensearch_cross_cluster_replication``.
