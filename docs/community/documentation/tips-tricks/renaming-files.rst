Rename files and adding redirects
===================================

The project supports a redirects file, named `_redirects`; the format is `source` and `destination` as paths relative to the root of the project. Here's an example::

    /docs/products/flink/howto/real-time-alerting-solution-cli.html    /docs/products/flink/howto/real-time-alerting-solution.html

If you are moving or renaming a file, put the old and new URLs into the file. If you are deleting a file, use the old URL and choose a good alternative landing place, such as a similar article, or a section homepage.
