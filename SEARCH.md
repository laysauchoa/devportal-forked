# Aiven Developer Portal custom search
QWEQW
Aiven Developer Portal uses custom OpenSearch based search. The files related to the search are:

- the search results page [\_templates/search.html](_templates/search.html)
- the search form for the sidebar [\_templates/sidebar/search.html](_templates/sidebar/search.html)
- the Netlify function that is used by the search results page [netlify/functions/search/search.js](netlify/functions/search/search.js)
- the python script that creates the index and index mapping [scripts/create_index.py](scripts/create_index.py)
- the python script that parses and adds the Developer Portal pages to the index [scripts/index_developer_portal_pages.py](scripts/index_developer_portal_pages.py)
- the python script that fetches, parses and adds the Help Center pages to the index [scripts/index_help_center_pages.py](scripts/index_help_center_pages.py)

## Index mapping

The index is described with the following JSON:

```json
{
    "dynamic": false,
    "properties": {
        "title": {
            "type": "text"
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "text"
        },
        "content": {
            "type": "text"
        },
        "source": {
            "type": "keyword"
        },
        "sort_priority": {
            "type": "integer"
        }
    }
    }
}
```

| Property      | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| title         | Document title, used as the link text in search results                                                                                                  |
| description   | Short document description, used in help center results under the title text                                                                             |
| content       | Main document content                                                                                                                                    |
| source        | Document source, currently either `devportal` or `helpcenter`                                                                                            |
| sort_priority | Document sort priority in search results, smaller priority documents are shown first and same priority documents are sorted by OpenSearch query score |

In addition to these `url` field should be provided with every document but it is not indexed or used in search queries. `url` is used in search result `href`.

## Search function

The OpenSearch index is used through the Netlify function in [netlify/functions/search/search.js](netlify/functions/search/search.js). To call the function, make a GET request to the function URL and append your search term to the `query` parameter, like this: [https://developer.aiven.io/.netlify/functions/search?query=redis](https://developer.aiven.io/.netlify/functions/search?query=redis).

The query uses this overall approach:

- use OR-style query matching `title`, `description` and `content` (with OS `match_phrase_prefix`)
- give higher value to `title`


# Creating the index

The index is created with [scripts/create_index.py](scripts/create_index.py). You can run it with

```
make create-index ES_URL=https://opensearch-url/here
```

This can be run multiple times and has to be run at least once before the other commands that add documents to the index.

The index name in Elasticsearch is `devportal`.

# Developer Portal page indexing

Developer Portal pages are indexed with [scripts/index_developer_portal_pages.py](scripts/index_developer_portal_pages.py).
The script parses built HTML files using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
and extracts document title from `title` element and document content from `main` element child that has a `content` class (CSS selector `main .content`).

Pages that we do not want to be indexed can be added to `INDEX_BLACKLIST` list in [scripts/index_developer_portal_pages.py](scripts/index_developer_portal_pages.py).

You can run the script with

```
make index-devportal ES_URL=https://opensearch.url/here
```

# Help Center page indexing

Developer Portal pages are indexed with [scripts/index_help_center_pages.py](scripts/index_help_center_pages.py).
The script fetches HTTP pages from [https://help.aiven.io/](https://help.aiven.io/) and parses them using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

You can run the script with

```
make index-helpcenter ES_URL=https://opensearch.url/here
```

## Adding documents to the index using Python

Using `elasticsearch` library:

```python
import hashlib
from opensearchpy import OpenSearch

# Create the client instance
os_client = OpenSearch(['https://opensearch.url/here'], use_ssl=True)

# Loop:

# Form the document that you want to index
document = {
    'title': 'How to use Kafka',
    'description': 'This guide will get you started with Kafka',
    'content': 'Long document...',
    'url': 'https://aiven.io/contact',
    'source': 'helpcenter',
    'sort_priority': 2,
}

# Send the document to the index
os_client.index(index='devportal',
         body=document,
         id=hashlib.sha256(page['url'].encode("utf-8")).hexdigest())
```

You might also need to take care of removing documents that no longer exist.

# Synonyms

If you want to alias one search term to another, then you can update the file `scripts/synonyms.json` with comma-separated lists of aliases.  For example:
```
[
     "postgresql, postgres, pg",
     "kafka, kafak, kfaka"
]
```
Note the lack of a trailing comma on the final term; this file must be valid JSON.

The aliases are used at index-creation time, so if this file changes then the index needs to be re-created before it will take effect.

# Testing changes to search functionality

It seems like Netlify uses the deployed functions rather than the ones in a branch when building a preview, so we need to take care when testing these. A good approach is to use the [Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/products/cli/) locally. For example, to test the search function:

1. Create an OpenSearch service on Aiven, copy the URL and then set it as the environment `ES_URL` in your terminal

2. Run `make create-index` and then `make index-helpcenter` and `make index-devportal` to populate the OpenSearch data (you can go browse with OpenSearch dashboards at this point if you're interested)

3. From the `netlify/` directory, run `netlify dev` - this starts a server on port 8888 (but won't serve the site itself because we don't have configuration to run it locally, I think it would be possible if we needed to though)

4. The search function is now available at `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/search` - add `?query=kafka` or whatever your search query should be, to check that the function works and returns the results you expect. The local server will show error logs if there are any.
